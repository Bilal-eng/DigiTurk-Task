## DigiTurk App - README
### Description
The Digiturk app is an Android application developed in Kotlin with Clean Architecture 
that shows some functionality like viewing the list of genres and film categories and when swiping the page it shows the films of every category.

### **Libraries used within the application and what is the benefit of each library:**
### _Clean Architecture:_
Clean Architecture is a design principle that emphasizes the separation of concerns in software development. It divides the application into layers (Presentation, Domain, and Data) to ensure a clear and scalable structure. Clean Architecture facilitates testability, maintainability, and adaptability to changing requirements, making it an excellent choice for building robust and modular Android applications.

### Retrofit:
Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java that simplifies the process of making network requests. It allows you to define your API as an interface, handles the conversion of JSON responses, and offers other features like request/response logging. Retrofit's simplicity, ease of use, and robustness make it a popular choice for networking in Android apps.

### Glide:
Glide is a fast and efficient image-loading library for Android. It simplifies the loading and caching of images, providing features like automatic memory and disk caching, as well as support for animated GIFs. Glide is widely used due to its performance optimizations, ease of integration, and comprehensive image-loading capabilities.

### Hilt Dependency Injection:
Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the implementation of Dagger, making it easier to manage dependencies in your Android app. It provides a standardized way to perform dependency injection in Android components such as activities, fragments, and services. Hilt promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability in your codebase.

### DataBinding:
DataBinding is a library that allows you to bind UI components in your layout files directly to data sources, eliminating the need for boilerplate code to update the UI. It promotes a declarative approach to UI development, reducing the amount of code you need to write and maintain. DataBinding can lead to more readable and maintainable code by directly linking UI elements with underlying data.

### Flow and Kotlin Coroutines:
Flow and Kotlin Coroutines are part of the Kotlin programming language and are often used together. Kotlin Coroutines provides a way to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. Flow is a reactive stream library that leverages Kotlin Coroutines for building asynchronous, non-blocking data streams. Together, they offer a modern and concise approach to handling asynchronous operations in Android, replacing traditional callback-based mechanisms.

## Why I Use Them:
* Clean Architecture: Promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability by enforcing a clear separation of concerns and a modular structure.

* Retrofit: Simplifies network requests with a clean and type-safe API, making it easy to work with RESTful services and handle asynchronous operations.

* Glide: Offers fast and efficient image loading with built-in caching and support for various image formats, enhancing the user experience in apps with rich media content.

* Hilt Dependency Injection: Streamlines dependency management, making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable by providing a standardized way to perform dependency injection in Android components.

* DataBinding: Reduces boilerplate code by allowing you to bind UI components directly to data sources, leading to more readable and maintainable UI code.

* Flow and Kotlin Coroutines: Provide a modern, concise, and readable approach to handling asynchronous operations, replacing callback-based mechanisms and making asynchronous code more straightforward and maintainable.
